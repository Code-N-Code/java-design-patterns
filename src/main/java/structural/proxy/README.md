# Factory Method Pattern


The Factory Method Pattern is a **Creational Design Pattern** that provides an interface for creating objects but allows 
subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.
It helps in **encapsulating** the object creation logic,promoting **loose coupling** and making the code more 
**flexible** and **maintainable**.

## About the implementation
Factory Method Pattern is implemented using two different approaches.
1. Simple Approach: In this approach a single factory class is used to create multiple products (class objects).
2. Preferred Approach: In this approach a single factory class is used for a single concrete class.
